Each bee will have their information displayed as 
ID:
Health:
Status

When the solution is running a button nameed "Damage" will reduce the health of each bee and update their status.
Eventually the health of every bee will remain constant as all bees are condiered dead and no further health is deducted.

Due to the time limit, I did not get much of a chance to have the application runable and will therefore require an IDE to run it.
